To the Late King <i>JAMES</i>,<br />
<span class="smaller">BY THE</span><br />

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-t.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">That the late King
<i>James</i> was induc’d by the
<i>Emissaries</i> of <i>Rome</i>, to
trample upon the Laws
and Liberties of the Subjects
of these Three Kingdoms,
there is no body
who enjoys the use of their Reason, can deny.
But tho we felt every day new Invasions
made upon our Religion by the same
Party of men under the Covert of the <i>Royal
Power and Prerogative</i> (as they call’d it); yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
there are to this very day, a certain incredulous
sort of men, who have the folly to tell
us, <i>That King <span class="antiqua">James</span> had never the least Design
to alter the Religion of these Kingdoms, or to introduce
Popery</i>.</p>

<p>Among a Thousand Instances to prove that
King <i>James</i>’s great Design was <i>the utter extirpation
of the Protestant Religion, and the Restitution</i>
(as the Papists call it) <i>of the Catholick one</i>,
There has of late <i>one</i> come to light, which
sets the Affair in a Meridian light, beyond
all possibility of doubting; which Instance,
and the occasion of its coming to be known,
is as follows.</p>

<p class="tb">The Late King upon his arrival in <i>Ireland</i>
from <i>France</i>, did make as considerable
Steps to overturn the Protestant Religion
and Interest in that Kingdom, as the short
time he was there, and the <i>Decorum</i> he was
to carry towards the few Protestants who adher’d
to him, could possibly admit of. A
great many Laws made for the safety of the
<i>English</i> Protestants, and for keeping out the
<i>Irish</i> from the possessions they had by so many
Rebellions justly forfaulted, were rescinded:
And, which was next to giving the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
final Blow to the Protestant Interest in that
Kingdom, King <i>James</i>, in his <i>Irish</i> pretended
Parliament, had formally removed the Fundamental
<i>Charter</i>, by which the Protestants
possest their Estates; I mean, the Act of
Parliament of <i>Ireland</i>, called, <i>The Act of Settlement</i>:
So it seem’d, there wanted scarce
any more to be done, to restore Popery and
Papists for good and all in <i>Ireland</i>.</p>

<p>But all this was not able to satisfie the
<i>fiery Zealots</i> of the Church of <i>Rome</i>, whom
nothing could please, but <i>a thorough work</i>, as
they named it. The <i>Irish Popish Bishops</i> meet
together in the <i>Titular Archbishop of <span class="antiqua">Dublin</span>’s
Lodgings</i>; and with them, <i>The Provincials of
all the Religious Orders</i>: And having unanimously
agreed to the following <i>Address</i> or
<i>Memorial</i> to be presented to the late King,
then in <i>Dublin</i>, they present it to him in a
full Body. That King <i>James</i> received this
<i>Address</i> very kindly, was visible in his manner
of treating the Persons that presented
it. He told them, <i>They had never any reason
to doubt of his Zeal for the Catholick Religion;
and of his willingness to sacrifice all that was dear
to him upon that account</i>. And that he would
within a few days acquaint my <i>Lord Archbishop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
of Dublin</i>, with his Resolutions and Answer
to their Address.</p>

<p>What Answer King <i>James</i> returned, we
have not yet been able to learn. But the
<i>Memorial</i> it self was found in that King’s
<i>Closet</i>, after his leaving <i>Dublin</i>; and another
Copy of the same, in the <i>Archbishop</i>’s <i>Lodgings</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Memorial</i> it self deserves to be here
inserted word by word, as it is in the <i>Original</i>
found in King <i>James</i>’s Closet: And it may
not be impertinent to make some short Reflections
on each Paragraph, as they lye in
order.</p>

<h2>The <i>Memorial</i> runs thus.</h2>

<p>SIR,</p>

<p><span class="gothic">As we are very sensible of Your Majesties
Great Zeal to Establish the Roman
Catholick Religion in this Your Kingdom
of</span> Ireland, <span class="gothic">and own our selves extremely
thankful and beholding to Your Majesty for
Your Gracious Declaration to us upon that
Subject; So pursuant to Your Majesties
Directions and Encouragement, we herein
most humbly offer the means that to us seem
most efficacious for the due Accomplishing
thereof.</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<h2>Reflections.</h2>

<p>Here is a fair acknowledgment of <i>a Design
to establish the Roman-Catholick Religion in
Ireland</i>, which they expresly say, <i>King <span class="antiqua">James</span>
had declared to them</i>, and had previous thereto
<i>given them Directions and Incouragement about it</i>.
One would think, The <i>Titular Archbishop of
Dublin</i>, and the rest of the <i>Gang</i>, needed few
Directions to go about so meritorious a
Work as the Establishment of the Catholick
Religion: But it seems King <i>James</i> his Zeal
has outgone even <i>theirs</i> in this point. He
has not only <i>given them Directions about it</i>,
but <i>incourag’d them in it</i>. And we know the
word <i>Incouragement</i>, is a very entensive one;
as including not only <i>promises to assist, but
means and power to bring about</i>. And we have
no reason to doubt, but King <i>James</i>, though
he thought not himself oblig’d to keep his
word so often given to <i>English</i> Hereticks; yet
He would not fail to merit Heaven, by keeping
firm with those People He imagin’d
had power to lock Heaven against him in
case of a failure. And here by the by, I
think it but just, His Confessor should absolve
him from the obligation of his Promise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
to the Titular Archbishop of <i>Dublin</i>, and the
rest of them, since the entire Ruine of his
Affairs in <i>Ireland</i>, has put him out of capacity
to keep his word to them.</p>

<h2>Memorial.</h2>

<p>Imprimis, <span class="gothic">The usual and right Method for
to compass any End or Design, is first of all
to remove the Chief Obstacles that offer
thereunto; Wherefore, inasmuch as the Penal
Laws, particularly the Statute of Uniformity,
and other like, were originally devised
and enacted to abolish the Roman-Catholick
Religion, and will continue to be
the main hindrance of its advancement;
We humbly conceive that to re-establish the
same Roman-Catholick Religion in this
Kingdom, as Your Majesty graciously intends,
it is in all Conscience and Justice an
Act of indispensible necessity to repeat those
aforesaid Penal Laws so thoroughly repugnant
to the Honour and true Worship of
God, and to the Salvation of Souls</span>.</p>

<h2>Reflections.</h2>

<p>What a Barrier the <i>Penal Laws</i> are against
Popery here, the Papists themselves do witness;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
And what an <i>Eye-sore</i> they are to them,
they fairly enough insinuate by their earnestness
with King <i>James</i>, in this Paragraph,
to <i>have them Repeal’d</i>. Here it is we have
reason to admire and praise the wise and
happy Conduct of the Church of <i>England</i> in
the late Reign, who would not be impos’d
upon to take off these Laws, which the Papists
as well as they, knew to be a <i>firm barrier</i>
against Popery, and a sure fence for securing
the Protestant Religion; Whatever
other glosses were put upon them by some
of that time. This does sufficiently free that
Church from the imputation of <i>wilfulness</i>
and <i>moroseness</i> thrown upon them by their
Enemies upon the account of their Refusal
in this matter: since the Papists themselves
acknowledge in the above-mentioned Paragraph,
That <i>these Laws were originally enacted
to abolish the Roman-Catholick Religion, and to
be the main hinderance of its advancement</i>. And
indeed they must have been very blind, that
did not see through the Designs of the late
Reign, in their Intriegues of repealing these
Laws: And it were a great Reflection upon
the Wisdom of the <i>Dissenters</i>, to think
they had any other thoughts of the Court-Designs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
at that time, or that they could be
brought to imagine, there was any real
kindness meant towards them, either in the
Toleration granted them, or in the Insinuations
made them to take off the Penal
Laws. For there was no Party of men
more odious to the Papists, than the <i>Dissenters</i>,
notwithstanding of all the Caresses made
them, merely to juggle them into their own
Ruine, and the Ruine of the Church of
<i>England</i>.</p>

<h2>Memorial.</h2>

<p>IIdly, <span class="gothic">whereas Almighty God of his Divine
Providence has placed Bishops in his
Church, bought and redeemed by the Price
of his most Precious Blood, for to rule and
govern the same, and for to enlighten the
People into the true and only way of Salvation,
as is apparent in Holy Writ; It
followeth by an unavoidable consequence,
that it is not only conducive, but also absolutely
requisite for the establishment of this
Roman-Catholick Church in its due lustre
and decorum in this Kingdom; That the
Prelates and other Clergy thereof, be restored
to their Livings, Churches, and full exercise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
of their Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction, without
which it is not to be expected that they can
prevail to repress the Vices most swaying in
this Age, and make the Christians improve
themselves with more serious application in
the observance of God’s Law, and in the
wholsome practice of Piety and Virtue: For
we find by Experience, that the People now-a-days,
generally speaking, will not much
heed or regard the Exhortations or Threatnings
of their Ghostly Directors, when they
see them reduced to so low an ebb of Indigence,
as to depend of themselves for their
spiritual Power and Authority</span>.</p>

<h2>Reflections.</h2>

<p>In the last Reign we were industriously
told over and over again, by the Late King’s
<i>Emissaries</i>, That there was never any thing
of a Design to invade the Livings or Revenues
of the Church, or of applying of them
to any body else, but those of the Church of
<i>England</i>. Here the Mask is taken off, and
the true Design of appropriating the Revenues
of the Church, to <i>the use of the Roman-Catholicks</i>
alone, is downright confest. This
was really design’d long before: And we had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
<i>Bishops</i> consecrated by the Pope, for almost
all the <i>Bishopricks</i> of <i>England</i> and <i>Ireland</i>: But
the Affair was not ripe enough to install
them in their <i>Livings</i>. These Bishops by
the <i>Canon-Law</i>, and by the acknowledgment
of all the Lawyers of <i>Rome</i>, <i>Had an undoubted
legal Right to the Revenues of their Titular Bishopricks,
and that immediately upon their being
nominated by the Pope</i>: Likeas the Protestant
Bishops were but Usurpers and illegal Possessors
of those Revenues, if we believe <i>Romish</i>
Casuists. Now they put King <i>James</i> in
mind of <i>his gracious Declaration to them upon
that Subject</i>; And they must have their Foot
in, and the new Possessors (as they take the
Protestants to be) must be set a packing for
good and all. At the end of this Paragraph,
our <i>Irish Bishops</i> and <i>Provincials</i>, do formally
contradict their so much cry’d-up <i>Vow of Poverty</i>;
And tell us plainly, That <i>the People will
not have regard to the Advices of their Ghostly Directors,
when they see them reduced to so low an ebb
of indigence, as to depend of themselves for their
spiritual Power and Authority</i>. Here they plainly
insinuate, that <i>Poverty</i> is obstructive of <i>the
Peoples profiting by their directions</i>; And thence
it is, They must have the Livings of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
Clergy restor’d to them, to give a greater
lustre to <i>their spiritual Power and Authority</i>. At
this rate, the Clergy of the first <i>three Centuries</i>,
and the <i>Mendicant Orders</i> of their own
Church of <i>Rome</i>, must have very little success
in their Ministerial Functions, since they
of old did absolutely depend, and these new
Orders do yet, upon the sole Charity of the
People.</p>

<h2>Memorial.</h2>

<p>IIIdly, <span class="gothic">Though it may, perhaps seem to
some Politicks, that this Restoring the Roman-Catholick
Religion and Clergy here to
their Livings, Churches, Jurisdiction and
Privileges, may be inconsistent at present
with the Prospect of Your Majesty’s Affairs
in</span> England, <span class="gothic">and may alienate the Affections
of the Protestants there, from giving a helping
hand, as may be expected, towards Your
Majesty’s Restauration; yet, with submission,
we conceive that this Objection carries
more seeming than solid Reason; for when
did it ever prove successful to Your Majesty,
or to any of Your Royal Predecessors, so far
to humour the Protestants of</span> England <span class="gothic">in Concerns
of this nature relating to the Glory of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
God, and good of Souls? What return did
they make in these latter times to Your Majesty’s
manifold Condescentions and Indulgences
to them? Did not they, even their
Chief Clergy, bring in Foreign Power to invade
Your Throne, without regarding the
Loyalty and Allegiance they swore unto
You? Moreover, if those Protestants, Laity
and Clergy of</span> England, <span class="gothic">or any of them, be
now turn’d really Loyal, and well-affected
to Your Majesty; surely they will not in
any reason be displeased, or grudge, that in
this Your Catholick Kingdom, always Loyal,
Your Majesty should establish, as aforesaid,
the Roman Religion, as also the Clergy
thereof, who always preach and teach Loyalty
and Obedience to their King, to be an
essential Maxim of the Religion and Law of
God. Neither will the said Protestants upon
that consideration of Your Majesty’s Gracious
Restoring the Roman-Catholick Religion
and Clergy as desired, flinch off, or desist
from co-operating to Your Majesty’s Restauration,
no more than the</span> Irish <span class="gothic">Roman-Catholicks
have done, when deprived of their Estates,
and brought under severe Laws against
their Religion, yet always kept touch
to their Loyalty and Allegiance in defending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
Your Majesties Cause. On the other side,
if the said Protestants be not sincerely Loyal,
but only Act for their own Temporal Interest
under the pretext of Religion, in their
usual manner, how can Your Majesty much
rely upon their assistance, or after Your Restoration,
(which God send soon and happy)
expect that they will give You any way, but
rather all imaginable hindrance to establish,
as you purpose, the</span> Roman-<span class="gothic">Catholick Religion
and Clergy, in this Your Kingdom of</span> Ireland,
<span class="gothic">in that full manner aforesaid?</span></p>

<h2>Reflections.</h2>

<p>Here, in the beginning of this Paragraph,
we have fairly insinuated, the true Reasons
<i>why King <span class="antiqua">James</span> did not restore</i>, when upon
the <i>English</i> Throne, <i>the Roman Catholick Religion,
and the Clergy, to their Livings, Churches, Jurisdictions,
and Privileges</i>, tho he design’d to do
it when it was convenient: The Reason was,
<i>It was inconsistent with the good of King <span class="antiqua">James</span>’s
Affairs at that time</i>. But why was not this
done, when King <i>James</i> came to <i>Ireland</i>, and
was at the Head of an <i>Irish</i> Army? The
Reason that induc’d him to delay it, is here
plain; <i>He was afraid it might alienate the affections<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
of the Protestants in <span class="antiqua">England</span>, from giving a
helping hand towards his Restoration</i>. He did
not delay it upon the account of the unjustness
of the thing it self; it was from another
Principle, even that of <i>Politicks</i>, lest the Protestants
of <i>England</i> should be too much
alarm’d with it. Thus King <i>James</i> and his
Popish Clergy must have very low thoughts
of the Wit and Sense of the Protestants of
<i>England</i>, to think they could be so easily
cheated with such silly baits, and could be
hook’d in by so weak Pretences. No sure;
they could not be so short-sighted, as not to
see through these Cobwebs of <i>Romish</i> Politicks;
and they had too many hints of their
Designs, not to be ignorant what was really
at the bottom of them.</p>

<p>But it seems at the giving in of this Memorial,
the <i>Romish</i> Clergy was become of
another Opinion. They thought it not worth
their while to dissemble any longer, but that
it was absolutely fit to fall to work without
any further Ceremony. They tell King
<i>James</i> positively, <i>That it’s altogether needless to
humour the Protestants in concerns of this nature;
That all the return they made to his and his Predecessors
Kindness and Indulgences to them, was to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
Invite a Foreign Power to Invade his Throne</i>. Here
we are expresly told, That all the late
King’s <i>Kindness to the Protestants</i>, was only to
<i>humour them</i>, that is, to lay them asleep with
his Caresses, till it was time to give the Blow,
by restoring the <i>Roman</i>-Catholick Religion,
and the <i>Roman</i>-Catholick Clergy to their
Churches, Livings, <i>&amp;c.</i> But this is not all;
These Gentlemen tell us by way of an <i>Inuendo</i>,
That all the Privileges the Protestants
enjoyed by the Laws of the Kingdom, were
indeed no more, but <i>King James’s and his Predecessor’s
their manifold Condescentions and Indulgences
to them</i>: So that instead of Laws for
the Security of our Religion, we were in
the opinion of the <i>Romish</i> Clergy, obliged
only to the Condescention of our Kings for
our peaceable Enjoyment of it: And as all
<i>Favours</i> may be revoked upon the ingratitude
of them on whom they are bestowed; so
consequently may all the Liberties and Privileges
of the Protestants of <i>England</i>, be recall’d
in the sense of this Memorial, because
of the <i>bad returns they made that King for them</i>.
I know no reason why they here take in King
<i>James</i>’s <i>Royal Predecessors</i>, unless it be to insinuate
something against the Memory of King<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
<i>Charles</i> II. as if he and King <i>James</i> had been
upon the same bottom, as to their <i>Condescentions
and Indulgences</i> to the Protestants, and
therein <i>both of one Religion</i>; which how true,
we must refer to the Great Day, when all
hidden things shall be laid open.</p>

<p>As in the former part of this Paragraph,
the Givers in of this Memorial derogated
from the Wisdom of the whole Protestants of
<i>England</i>, in being cheated with their silly
Baits; So in the last Words of the Period
above mentioned, they fall foul upon the
Honesty of those Protestants that are upon
King <i>James</i>’s side, <i>as if they would not be displeased,
or grudg at the re-establishment of the <span class="antiqua">Romish</span>
Religion and Clergy in <span class="antiqua">Ireland</span>; but that notwithstanding
thereof, they would continue to co-operate
to His Restoration</i>. I am not concerned to
answer for the Protestant <i>Jacobites</i> in <i>England</i>;
here they have a Charge laid to their door
by others engaged in the same Bottom with
themselves; and how true the Charge is,
they and their own Consciences know best:
I shall only say, If it be so, as is here insinuated,
then it’s no wonder they should be the
Horror and Hatred of all Good Men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<h2>Memorial.</h2>

<p>Sir, <span class="gothic">Now is the true time for Your Majesty
to accomplish that Glorious Work: It is
not likely that hereafter any more easie or
better opportunity will happen for it, than
whilst we have the happy Enjoyment of Your
Majesties Presence amongst us: For it is
reasonably to be apprehended, that the Difficulties
to be surmounted in so godly a Design,
will rather be increased than diminished,
by the continual Suggestions of our Adversaries
against us to Your Majesty, when
restored to Your Throne in</span> England. <span class="gothic">Furthermore,
the very Protestants themselves cannot
in their hearts chuse but applaud, and
judg it in the main to be a necessary effect of
Royal Bounty and Justice, that those Livings,
Churches, and Prerogatives, which
were taken away from the</span> Roman-<span class="gothic">Catholick
Clergy by Protestant Kings and Parliaments,
should now, after so many Years
Sufferings, be restored back unto them by a</span>
Roman-<span class="gothic">Catholick King, with the Concurrence
of a</span> Roman-<span class="gothic">Catholick Parliament; were it
for no other Motive, than to gratifie Your</span>
Roman-<span class="gothic">Catholick Subjects of this Kingdom,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
who have so eminently signalized their Loyalty,
Allegiance, and constant good Zeal to
assert with their Lives and Fortunes, Your
Majesties Rights, in a time when Protestants
and Sectaries, nay also the chief, and
most part of the Protestant Clergy, did not
stick to stir up and bring in an Invasion, and
join hands with Your Enemies against
You</span>.</p>

<h2>Reflections.</h2>

<p>In the beginning of this <i>Paragraph</i>, they
seem unwillingly to tax the Protestants that
are on King <i>James</i>’s side, with what is indeed
no Crime, but a Duty, <i>viz.</i> <i>Their Suggestions
to him in case of his Restoration, against so godly
a work, as the restoring the <span class="antiqua">Romish</span> Religion and
Clergy</i>. I confess this is a Compliment some
of them do scarce deserve; and which is expresly
contradicted by what was said in the
former part of this same <i>Memorial</i>, in that,
That <i>they would not be displeased, nor grudg at
the re-establishment of the <span class="antiqua">Romish</span> Religion and
Clergy in <span class="antiqua">Ireland</span></i>. And it’s a question which
of the two Insinuations are most natural, and
most consequential to the Principles and Practices
of the Protestant <i>Jacobites</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>What a ridiculous piece of stuff is this!
<i>That the Protestants themselves will applaud in the
main, that necessary effect of Royal Bounty in a
<span class="antiqua">Roman</span>-Catholick King’s restoring back to the <span class="antiqua">Roman</span>
Catholicks, what a Protestant King and Parliament
had taken from them in <span class="antiqua">Ireland</span></i>. At the
same rate, and by the same parity of Reason,
what a Protestant King and Parliament has
taken away from the <i>Roman</i>-Catholicks in
<i>England</i>, should be now restored them by a
<i>Roman</i>-Catholick King, when he comes back
to the Throne of <i>England</i>. Indeed we have
no reason to doubt, but as the Reason is the
same, so the Manner of acting would be the
same in both Kingdoms; which is fairly
enough hinted in the Words themselves.</p>

<p>How eminently they have signaliz’d their
Loyalty and Allegiance to King <i>James</i> in this
Juncture, their Bravery and inimitable Courage
have evidenced with a Witness. The
truth is, it’s hard to say, Whether King <i>James</i>
be less oblig’d to the Valour of the <i>Irish</i>, or
they to his Conduct: I am of Opinion, They
will not be willing to try their Fortune
again, under such a General, nor He to try
His, with such Soldiers; And so there’s nothing
lost in point of Gratitude on either hand.</p>

<h2>Memorial.</h2>

<p><span class="gothic">What greater Mischief or Villany than
this can be apprehended from them! For not
to speak here of the Malicious endeavours
formerly used in their Parliament, to exclude
You from Your Right of Inheriting
the Crown, or of the Treacherous Plots and
Designs contrived by some of them, for to take
away Your Majesties Life, and that of Your
Royal Brother the late King of Blessed Memory:
And after all this, Is it reasonable
to repose any Confidence in them, or to expect
that ever they will prove real and true unto
You upon occasion of helping You to regain
Your Crown? Or certainly if they should
chance to give any such Encouragement, it
will not proceed from a real Love to Your
Royal Person, but that they find it necessary
for their Temporal Interests, which they
now experience to be in great danger, and
much prejudic’d by their late Rebellious Defection.
Consequently, as far as Your Return
may avail for the Preservation and Advantage
of those their Interests, they may
concur thereunto, without regarding any
Establishment whatever, that You make in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
this Kingdom, in favour of the</span> Roman-<span class="gothic">Catholick
Religion and Clergy; for they do not
doubt, but that Your Majesty being of the</span>
Roman-<span class="gothic">Catholick Religion, intends to establish
the same, and to restore the Clergy to
their Livings, Churches, and full Jurisdiction,
in this Your Catholick Kingdom</span>.</p>

<h2>Reflections.</h2>

<p>As to some of the Protestants <i>Design of
old to exclude King <span class="antiqua">James</span> from inheriting the
Crown</i>, as is here mentioned; The <i>Bill of
Exclusion</i>, as it was the result of the Counsels
of those who saw no other way at that
time to save <i>Us</i> from Popery and Slavery;
so it’s a question, Whether it had not been
better for that Prince that that Bill had taken
effect. For it seems to me, a far greater
misfortune, to be once upon a Throne, and
to put a necessity on the Nation to dethrone
him, than never to have been suffer’d once
to sit down upon it; And I believe that unhappy
Prince thinks so himself, by this time.
So that the Papists have no great reason to
blame the Protestants upon that head.</p>

<p>As to the Treacherous Plots and Designs
contriv’d by some of the Protestants to <i>take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
away the life King <span class="antiqua">James</span>, and of his Royal
Brother</i>, Alas! We all know where this Plot
was coyn’d; who they were that brought it
upon the Stage; and to what end.</p>

<p>This Protestant Plot here hinted at, was
thought upon by the Popish Party then at
Court, as the only proper means to stifle for
good and all the <i>Popish one</i>; And what <i>Villanies,
Perjuries, Subornations, Lyes and Murthers</i>,
were put in practice at that time, none in
<i>England</i> can be ignorant. It could be wish’d,
That for the honour of the Nation, and for
the honour both of the <i>Bar</i>, and of the <i>Bench</i>,
these things were buried in perpetual oblivion.</p>

<p>The Insinuation at the end of this Paragraph,
That <i>if those Protestants shall help King
<span class="antiqua">James</span> to regain his Crowns, it will proceed only
from a motive of temporal Interest</i>; I believe may
be very true in some sense. For certainly nothing
but a <i>false shew of temporal Interest</i> can ever
prevail with a Protestant to bring back King
<i>James</i>; since he must make account to lose
thereby all <i>spiritual Interests</i>, viz. those of his
own Religion, Conscience and immortal
Soul; And these he must necessarily resolve
to part with at the very moment he brings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
back that Prince to the <i>English</i> Throne. But yet
it’s but a false shew of temporal Interest at the
best; For not only the Ruine of his Religion,
but that of his <i>Property and Liberty</i> must attend
King <i>James</i> his Return. It’s then we must
submit our selves either to a <i>French Yoak</i>, or a
<i>Yoak after a French Model</i>; And then farewell
for ever the Liberties and Properties of the
Subjects of <i>England</i>.</p>

<p>That these Protestants (who the Memorial
confesses from a temporal Interest only
would help King <i>James</i> to regain his Crown)
<i>should have no regard to any Establishment He
should make in <span class="antiqua">Ireland</span> in favour of the Roman-Catholick
Religion and Clergy</i>: I hope it’s not
true of them. And if it be so, They are the
unhappiest and most hateful Wretches upon
Earth, as being willing for their trifling Interests
to sacrifice a whole Kingdom to <i>Rome</i>.</p>

<h2>Memorial.</h2>

<p><span class="gothic">What worse Resentments can they receive
of Your Majesty’s putting that Intention
now absolutely in Effect, than they may
of what other glorious things you have setled
in this Kingdom as means thereunto,
by making Catholick Corporations and Magistrates,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
and Judges, by rendering Roman-Catholicks
capable of all manner of Offices
and Employments, by putting the Government
Civil and Military into the hands of
the Roman-Catholicks, by breaking that
unjust Act of Settlement, and restoring the
Catholick Proprietors to their Ancient
Estates.</span></p>

<h2>Reflections.</h2>

<p>Here the Romish Clergy tell the World
plainly, That <i>the Restoring the Romish Religion,
and the Romish Clergy to their Churches and Livings,
merits no greater Resentment from the Protestants,
than the making Roman-Catholick Corporations
and Magistrates and Judges, the rendring all Roman-Catholicks
capable of Offices and Employments,
by putting the Government Civil and Military in
their hands</i>. I confess we are oblig’d to them
for telling us so; Especially considering that
in the last Reign some People look’d upon
these <i>last Innovations</i> to be no great business;
and were willing to concur, or at least
tamely to consent to them. We see what
a sense the Papists themselves had of these
Violations of our Law: It was all one in
their Eyes, as a <i>Re-establishment of the Romish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
Religion and Clergy</i>, which some of the Protestants
themselves would not believe: And
indeed the wiser part of the Protestants
thought the one was as just as the other. And
that the Royal Prerogative might be wrested
by Corrupt Judges and Lawyers then in pay,
to infer a power to do both.</p>

<h2>Memorial.</h2>

<p><span class="gothic">These are Changes of far greater difficulties,
and more apt to exasperate the Protestants
of</span> England; <span class="gothic">and yet without regarding
their Displeasure, Your Majesty, praised be
God, was successfully prevail’d on to compass
these Glorious Alterations. How then can
it be thought reasonable that the Consideration
of displeasing or exasperating the said
Protestants of</span> England, <span class="gothic">should influence upon
Your Majesty to postpone or let slip this present
Opportunity of Re-establishing Your
Roman-Catholick Clergy of this Kingdom
in the full manner aforementioned?</span></p>

<h2>Reflections.</h2>

<p>If the late Circumstances wherein King
<i>James</i> was in <i>Ireland</i>, was so favourable an opportunity
to Re-establish the Roman-Catholick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
Religion in that Kingdom, as the
<i>Memorial</i> affirms, Then much more was the
Circumstances he was in here in <i>England</i>,
some two years ago, a favourable Opportunity
to Re-establish the Romish-Catholick
Religion in this Kingdom. In <i>Ireland</i> King
<i>James</i>’s Power was only confined to that
Island, and he was destitute of the Support
and Assistance of the Two other Kingdoms
that had been once <i>His</i>. He had,
when in <i>Ireland</i>, a powerful Prince possest
of these two other Kingdoms, and of
a part of <i>Ireland</i> it self, who was ready to
beat him out of the rest, at the Head of a
brave well-disciplin’d Army, while King
<i>James</i> had no reason to hope any great things
from His, made up of Cowardly Ill-disciplin’d,
and as ill-pay’d <i>Irishes</i>. King <i>James</i>’s
Circumstances were far better two years ago,
being Master of Three Kingdoms, and of a
brave and numerous Army, and no body to
oppose him. So that if his <i>Will was the same</i>
as to the Re-establishment of the Romish
Religion, (as no body doubts but it was)
<i>Then his Power was much greater two years ago,
when in <span class="antiqua">England</span>, than two or three months ago
when in <span class="antiqua">Ireland</span>, at the time of presenting him this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
Memorial</i>. Thus that Unfortunate, Misguided
Prince was in all his Conduct <i>wise too
late</i>, though to the great happiness of
these Three Kingdoms, as the Event has
prov’d.</p>

<h2>Memorial.</h2>

<p><span class="gothic">We must confess, that such an Intire Establishment
of the Roman-Catholick Clergy in</span>
England, <span class="gothic">would perhaps prove very difficult,
and provoke the Indignation of the Protestants
in a high measure, because it is contrary
to the Persuasion generally held by
the People there, who though never so different
amongst themselves in their Tenets,
yet agree together in bearing so implacable
an aversion to the Roman-Catholick Religion
and Clergy, that it is not to be expected
they would ever concur in their Parliaments
thereunto: But the Case is quite otherways
in this Your Majesty’s Kingdom
of</span> Ireland; <span class="gothic">for the People here being generally
Roman-Catholicks, incomparably exceeding
in number all Sectaries and Protestants,
covet nothing more, than to have
their own Roman-Catholick Clergy Re-established
amongst them in those Churches and
Livings that the Piety and Devotion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
their Ancestors, time out of mind, conferr’d
upon them for the Service and Honour of God,
and for their decent Subsistence; and restor’d
to the full Exercise of their Spiritual Jurisdiction,
and enjoyment of their Privileges</span>.</p>

<h2>Reflections.</h2>

<p>We find the Romish Clergy do here usher
in the difficulty of Re-establishing the Romish
Religion in <i>England</i>, with a <i>perhaps</i>; And
they will not allow it to be impossible, but
only that it <i>would prove difficult</i>. I make
no doubt, but if things were at this day in
<i>England</i> upon the same foot they were in two
years ago, we should have heard of no <i>difficulty</i>
in this matter: It was then, in their
opinion, the easiest thing of a thousand to
Re-establish the Roman-Catholick Religion
in <i>England</i>: And by all their Actions and
words they express so much. I will not determine,
how far it was possible to bring
<i>England</i> in the last Reign, to comply with,
and embrace Popery. But this I may safely
say, That the Debaucheries with which the
Nation was poison’d in King <i>Charles</i>’s Reign,
had laid them open to any Change in Religion.
We all know <i>Atheism</i> is the fairest Introduction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
to <i>Popery</i>: And he that’s an <i>Atheist</i> to
day, may easily be a <i>Papist</i> to morrow, especially
if his Interest concur in the Change. We
saw how much Popery gain’d every day, and
how many men, and that of the first Rank,
Interest, and the Smiles of a Court, prevail’d
with to change their Religion they were
brought up in, for a new one they had never
taken the pains to examine further, than
as to the favourableness of it with the King.
Moreover, in <i>France</i> we had the example of a
vast many Thousand Protestants, who had
not the Courage nor Constancy to resist the
Methods taken by the <i>Romish</i> Emissaries to
bring them back to the Communion of <i>Rome</i>.
And the <i>French</i> Protestants were at least as
Zealous in their Religion, as we in ours, and
seem’d to be willing to venture as much for
it as we. So that I cannot either confute or
consent to this last part of the Memorial;
but must conclude with this; That we have
reason to bless God, and pay our Thanks
and Acknowledgment to the <i>Glorious Instrument</i>
he made use of, by whom we are put
out of fear of having our Constancy in the
Protestant Religion tried, at the rate we had
reason to expect not long ago.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>And thus I take leave of the <i>Memorial</i> of
the <i>Romish</i> Clergy, and leave them to the disappointments
they have met with, both in
that Kingdom and elsewhere, of all the hopes
they have been so long a rearing up to themselves;
and which now are vanisht into
smoke, upon the appearing of our Victorious
King in the Island, where they were to begin
<i>their thorough Work</i>.</p>

<h2>POSTSCRIPT.</h2>

<p>We live in an Age wherein some people have
the Impudence to deny things of themselves
as clear as the Sun in its Mid-day Light. Go and
enquire of the <i>Roman</i>-Catholicks in <i>France</i>, and other
Popish Countries, they will make no bones to confess
freely, That two years ago, <i>they had the greatest
Grounds possible to have hop’d for the Establishment of
the Catholick Religion, and the utter Extirpation of
what they call Heresie, through the Three Kingdoms of
<span class="antiqua">England</span>, <span class="antiqua">Scotland</span>, and <span class="antiqua">Ireland</span></i>. But at the same
time, go and enquire the opinion of some among
our selves at home, that call themselves Protestants,
in this point they will confidently tell you, <i>There was
never any such Change designed</i>. These people must
either be strangely stupid, or must from some one
reason or other find themselves oblig’d to dissemble a
thing that cannot, that will not be hid. The <i>Memorial</i>
I have before given a particular Copy of, is
a proof of such a Design, as <i>to change Religion in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
<span class="antiqua">Ireland</span></i>; and such a proof, as there can be no clearer
given for any thing in the world: But I have
thought fit in this Postscript to give another evidence
as clear as the former; but an Evidence that
proves not only a design to overturn the Protestant
Religion in <i>Ireland</i> alone, but likewise in the other
Two Kingdoms of this Island: And that is, <i>A Memorial
given in by <span class="antiqua">Monsieur</span> the Duke of <span class="antiqua">Chaulnes</span>,
Ambassador Extraordinary for the <span class="antiqua">French</span> King, to this
present Pope</i>, very soon after his coming to the Papacy.
The <i>Memorial</i> it self is to be found in several
of their Papers now printed at <i>Rome</i> and other
places of <i>Italy</i>, on the occasion of the present Transactions
betwixt the Court of <i>France</i>, and that of
<i>Rome</i>; and the Copy whence I take it, is the <i>Italian
Mercury of Venice, Numb. 1012</i>. The <i>Memorial</i> is
there mentioned at full length, and refers to a great
many other Heads, than what I need here to mention.
I shall only copy from the Original, those parts
of it that concern the Affairs of King <i>James</i>, or of
the <i>French</i> King as his Ally and Confederate.</p>

<p class="center tb">The Memorial is thus.</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>The Memorial and Representation made to our most Holy
Father the Pope, by His Excellency <span class="antiqua">Charles de
Albert</span>, Duke of <span class="antiqua">Chaulnes</span>, and Peer of <span class="antiqua">France</span>, Ambassador
Extraordinary, and Plenipotentiary from
His most Christian Majesty, to His Holiness, in
Name and Behalf of His most Serene Majesty, His
Master</i>.</p>

<p class="tb"><i>His Excellency does most unwillingly, and with the
most inward Grief, put His Holiness in mind of
the sad and unhappy Consequences that have arisen to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
the Catholick Church, by the unnecessary and ill-tim’d
mistakes entertain’d by the late Pope <span class="antiqua">Innocent II.</span> of
the most Serene King his Master. What dismal effects they
have produc’d, all <span class="antiqua">Europe</span> feels at this day with regret</i>.</p>

<p><i>The most Serene King his Master has done all in him
lies to deserve the name of the Eldest Son of the Church.
And by breaking into pieces that <span class="antiqua">Hydra</span> of Heresie,
which had in his own Kingdom for above an Age, trampled
upon all that was Sacred, he might have justly expected
better Returns of his Zeal for the Catholick Religion,
than he did meet with from the then Head of the
Church. It was not only in his own Kingdom, that his
most Serene Master did use his utmost Power and Interest
to root out Heresie, and to establish the true Ancient,
Catholick, and Apostolick Religion; but his Aims and Influence
went farther; and unless the late Pope <span class="antiqua">Innocent
II.</span> had wilfully obstructed his Designs by an untimous
and needless Breach betwixt him and the Crown of
<span class="antiqua">France</span>, the state of Christendom, and of the Catholick
Church, had been far better than it is at this day. All
this his Excellency does not represent to his Holiness out
of any design to cast Dust on the Ashes of his Predecessor;
for as the most Christian King his Master suffered as much
as ever Prince in his Circumstances and Quality did, from
the late Pope, and that without doing any action unbecoming
a true Eldest Son of the Church towards the common
Father and Head thereof; so he resolves for ever to banish
from himself, and bury in oblivion the remembrance
of these things.</i></p>

<p>Here the <i>French</i> Ambassadour does very fairly
confess as a great Honour to his Master, <i>That it was
not in his own Kingdom only, that he us’d his Interest
to root out Heresie; but that his Aims and Influence
went further; and if the late Pope’s breach with him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
had not hindered, The state of the Catholick Church had
been far better than it is now at this day</i>. What can
be more plain than this? And where could the
<i>French Designs and Influence to root out Heresie</i>, be
more effectual and more probable to lie, than in
<i>England</i>, at that time under the Reign of a Prince as
zealous a <i>Romanist</i> as himself, and in the nearest
conjunction with him in all ties of <i>Friendship and
Alliance</i>.</p>

<p>The rest of the <i>Memorial</i> contains a great many
other particulars relating to the Pretensions of the
<i>French</i> King, and Disputes between him and the late
Court of <i>Rome</i>: And therefore it’s needless here to
mention them. Only in the end He has this other
Article relating to the Affairs of <i>England</i>, which
runs thus.</p>

<p><i>His Excellency humbly intreats his Holiness to consider
in his Fatherly Care and Zeal, the horrid and inexpressible
prejudice the Catholick Church has received
by the fatal disappointment all her Sons have met with
in the misfortune of his Britannick Majesty; And that
just at the very instant of time, we were to expect all
good and great things for the Catholick Church from
that King’s Zeal and Affections to it. So that unless
speedy course be taken for that King’s Re-establishment,
not only all the joint Designs for the suppression of Heresie
will fall to the ground; but the Catholicks of those
Kingdoms will be in the saddest condition possible. And
the Holy Church depriv’d of those great Kingdoms</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Here is as fair a Confession as ever was made <i>of a
disappointment the Romish Church met with in the late
King’s Misfortune, and how great things that Party
expected from King <span class="antiqua">James</span> his Zeal for the <span class="antiqua">Romish</span>
Church: and in fine, of joint Designs for the suppression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
of Heresie</i>. And after this, I would fain know
who can doubt of our Intended Ruine, and that of our
Religion, if the late happy Revolution had not fallen
out?</p>
